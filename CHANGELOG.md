# Changelog

Breaking changes and release notes. Versions are git tags; the stable API
contract lives in `docs/api.md`, upgrade procedure in `docs/upgrading.md`.

## Unreleased

Behavioural eval harness (Admin → Eval):

- YAML test cases (`evals/` seeds + `$ORCH_DATA/custom/evals/`) run scripted
  or adaptive multi-turn conversations through the real agent loop — an
  unattended toolset (confirmation-gated tools excluded, except the
  sandbox-confined `fs.write`/`fs.edit` which run auto-approved against the
  per-case sandbox; cloud `llm.call` stays in but auto-denied, so privacy
  gates are really tested), which also redirects the memory/RAG stores, so a
  run can neither pollute real memory nor pull it into a judge transcript —
  graded by a state-aware judge model: it sees the run's available tools,
  the live system prompt, and the relevant tool descriptions next to the
  transcript (`eval:` config section; cloud alias with local-specialist
  fallback, temperature 0). The only budget is $.
- Results, judge notes and pass-rate trends persist in `eval.db`, with a
  Statistics view (KPI cards, daily pass-rate/score trend, per-case
  flakiness, A/B period comparison, per-brain results); failures produce
  deduplicated WHAT/CAUSE/FIX proposals — nothing auto-applies. Accepting
  one applies to the custom layer only: prompt/skill tweaks extend the
  shipped artifact's overlay copy, tool descriptions are replaced via
  `custom/tool-overrides.yaml`, whitelisted config knobs go through the
  override path, bug-for-dev writes a ready-to-paste issue.
- Flags grow an "include private context" opt-in (default off) and a
  "make test" button that drafts a case from a flag's coroner report via a
  local model only — flagged content never leaves the box.
- `eval.run` / `eval.list` / `eval.report` tools let the agent self-test;
  cases share via `.jaypack`. 14 seed cases ship in `evals/`.

Gate prompt overlay:

- The shipped `prompts/orchestrator-gate.md` stays pristine. Live edits —
  the Admin → Prompt tab and accepted eval prompt-tweaks — write an overlay
  in the data dir that wins while present, apply to the next run, and can be
  reverted to the shipped prompt, so deploys never conflict with live prompt
  edits.

Install simplification + pre-1.0 cleanup:

- `scripts/setup.sh` (full installer: prereqs, venvs, env file with
  auto-generated secrets, systemd units, linger) and `scripts/quickstart.sh`
  (one-command minimal install: prebuilt llama-server + model download)
- `scripts/orch --doctor` — install validator (10 checks with fix hints);
  `scripts/pull-model` — interactive HuggingFace GGUF downloader
  (`ORCH_MODELS`, default `/srv/models`)
- LiteLLM master key now optional for localhost-only installs (render omits
  it when `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY` is unset)
- runtime.yaml typo guard: boot warns on unknown config sections with
  "did you mean …" hints
- Default model set defined (docs/models.md): fresh installs seed
  brain = Qwen3-4B, embed/rerank = Qwen3 0.6B (all Apache-2.0) — code
  fallbacks, shipped presets and quickstart all point there; existing
  presets.db catalogs are untouched (seed applies to empty DBs only)
- Ports (`ORCH_LITELLM_PORT`, `ORCH_WEB_PORT`) and trusted proxy IP
  (`ORCH_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`) configurable via the env file
- Retired `llama-brain1`/`llama-specialist` units (process manager owns
  models); templates moved to `example_configs/` with `.example` naming;
  version shown in the web UI; `docs/models.md` license-clean model picks

## 0.9.0 — 2026-08-04

First tagged release. Feature-complete daily driver; the 0.9.x line is
contract-hardening toward 1.0 (public open-source release) — see
docs/development.md → Versioning.

Highlights since development started (squashed):

- Web console: multi-user auth (+TOTP 2FA), per-user chats/projects, quick
  settings, run budgets, inline diffs, light/dark theme
- Agent runtime: local-first routing brain + specialist slots, preset
  catalog with GPU/CPU placement, strengths-aware delegation, ~100 tools,
  skills/chains, Studio (admin-created skills/chains/connectors + .jaypack
  share), wiki, memory + KG, trace mining, verify/council/ops tools
- Voice channel `/api/voice` with `voice:false` chat mode for native
  clients; per-user API tokens; SSE streaming; scheduled runs; flags/coroner
- Admin console: status + hardware, processes, presets, prompt, config,
  tools, users, flags, RAG
- Repo hygiene: MIT license, secrets sweep (clean), paths centralized in
  `runtime/paths.py`, nginx example, stable API contract + upgrade guide
